# Digital Clock ⏰

This is a basic digital clock made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds — and updates automatically every second. The layout is clean, center-aligned, and designed with a modern dark theme.

### Features
- Real-time time updates
- 24-hour format
- Responsive design
- Simple and easy to understand

### Why I made this
I created this project to practice working with JavaScript's `Date` object and understand how real-time updates work using `setInterval()`.  
It also helped me improve my CSS skills, especially with Flexbox and styling.  
**Built this as part of my front-end practice journey.**
